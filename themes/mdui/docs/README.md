# HEXO-THEME-MDUI

> An awesome hexo theme with Material Design.

## Materials
The whole theme is based on [mdui](http://mdui.org/) front end.

It has some basic feature, for example, using lightgallery to open images, code hightlight...

And it also has some advanced feature, such as builtin
service worker, and etc.

## Designs
I don't know what exactly the design is LOL.

There are two versions,
1.x version has 2 schemes, one looks like Google Plus, the other looks like Google Now
2.x version has only one schemes, a totally new design.
