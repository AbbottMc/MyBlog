## Custom css and js

At the same time, in the **theme config**, set `custom_head` or `custom_js` to `true` which is under `vendors`.

## Custom Comment
please open `layout/_custom/custom_comment.ejs` in the theme folder, and paste the comment service code to this file.
If the comment service needs you to set the `source id (or something like that)` of the page, please fill it with `<%- config.url + config.root + page.path %>`

If you use the router version, please make sure your comment service supports `reset()` method, or your comments will be shown in same page.
For exampleï¼ŒDisqus provides `reset()` method:
```` javascript
DISQUS.reset({
        reload: true,
        config: function () {
          this.page.identifier = newIdentifier;
          this.page.url = newUrl;
          this.page.title = newTitle;
        }
      });
````
If your comment service supports `reset()` method, please add following lines when you add your code:
```` javascript
themeRuntime.commentRest.function = function (newIdentifier, newUrl, newTitle) {
     example.reset({...})
   }
````
`example.reset({...})` is the `reset()` method that is provided by your comment service,if it needs identifier(s), please choose following identifiers:
- `newIdentifier` provides current page's URL
- `newUrl` is the same
- `newTitle` provides current page's title

## random_pics
This is the ramdom pictures for the posts which have not thumbnail. HEXO will choose a picture in  the theme folder `source/img/random` as post thumbnail.

If you don't need the feature, just leave here blank or set to `false`.

There are 44 built-in pictures. If you want to add pictures, please make sure the picture format is `png` and named as `number`, and change the numbers here, otherwise the thumbnail will not showed and you get a 404 in console.

!> No matter you add or delete pictures, please make sure the number starts from `1` and ends in number order.
